### Before going to test the app, you must subscribe https://openweathermap.org to get weather api key.

### Once you have your api key, you must integrate it to the code into CallWeatherApi.jsx in line 6.

`const weatherApi = "your api key";`

### Nice, all done, you can run `npm install` and `npm start` to test the app.
